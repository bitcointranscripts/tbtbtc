Have you ever spent time trying to find an exact moment in a video? Look no further! We’re introducing Video Chapters on Desktop, Android and iOS, which allows you to jump forward to a specific section of a video, rewatch a portion of a video, and more. Chapters appear at the bottom of the video player and use timestamps from the creator's video description.  Note: chapters are only shown on videos if the creator has included them.
